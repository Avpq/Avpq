## Hi, I'm Avezz 👋

### ⚙️ Silicon Orchestrator

**Software Developer | Systems Thinker | Data Science Enthusiast**

I believe the world runs on **0|1**—and I specialize in understanding what happens between those states. While many developers build features at the application layer, I dive deep into systems to understand how code and machine interact. This isn't just about writing working code; it's about understanding the fundamental principles that govern computation, from statistical models down to hardware execution.

### My Approach: First Principles Thinking

I approach problems by breaking them down to their fundamental components. When debugging a performance issue, I don't just profile the code—I ask why the CPU is stalling, how memory is being accessed, and what the compiler is actually generating. When building a time series forecasting model, I don't just plug in libraries—I understand the mathematics, the assumptions, and the computational trade-offs.

This first principles methodology means I don't accept abstractions at face value. Whether I'm working with the JVM's garbage collector, SARIMA's seasonal decomposition, or a data visualization pipeline, I trace execution paths down to their roots. **Understanding beats convention. Fundamentals outlast frameworks.**

### The Hardware-Software Bridge

Modern software engineering often treats hardware as an abstraction to be ignored. I reject that notion. The best optimizations, the most elegant solutions, and the most resilient systems emerge when you understand both sides of the stack:

- **From algorithms to silicon**: I write code aware of cache hierarchies, instruction pipelines, and memory bandwidth constraints
- **From data to decisions**: My statistical models aren't black boxes—I understand their mathematical foundations and computational requirements
- **From abstraction to implementation**: I can explain what happens when you type `model.fit()` at every layer of the stack

This hardware-software consciousness allows me to write code that doesn't just work—it works *efficiently* on the machines that execute it.

### What Drives Me

🔍 **Deep Understanding Over Quick Fixes** - I'd rather spend time understanding the root cause than applying patches
📊 **Rigorous Thinking** - Whether it's statistical modeling or systems debugging, I value mathematical and engineering rigor
🛠️ **Hands-On Learning** - Every project is an opportunity to understand something deeply, to ask "why" five times until I reach bedrock
🌐 **Bridging Domains** - I translate complexity: explaining technical depth to stakeholders, turning business problems into elegant implementations
⚡ **Performance Consciousness** - Optimization isn't premature when it's informed by understanding how systems actually work

### My Philosophy

> "Most engineers stop at the abstraction boundary. I start there."

True mastery in software engineering requires understanding systems at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. The best solutions emerge when you can think about algorithmic complexity while being aware of cache miss patterns, or design a statistical model while understanding its memory footprint.

I don't just use tools and frameworks—I understand their implementation, their trade-offs, and their failure modes. This depth enables me to make informed architectural decisions, debug issues others can't reproduce, and optimize code paths that benchmarks miss.

### Open for Opportunities

💼 I'm actively seeking opportunities where **deep technical thinking creates real value**—roles where understanding systems from first principles is an asset, not an afterthought. Whether it's building predictive models that scale, optimizing critical performance paths, or architecting systems that need to be both correct and efficient, I bring a level of technical depth that cuts through complexity.

If your team values engineers who ask "why" and "how" as much as "what", let's connect.
